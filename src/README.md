## Preliminary notes
1. All software is tested on a machine running Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS with Robot Operating System (ROS) Noetic. The setup should work on other Ubuntu versions as well, but we cannot guarantee this. If you encounter any issues, please let us know by creating an issue in this repository.

2. Note that some links in this and other READMEs do not work on [github.com](https://github.com). To view the links, clone the repository including all its submodules and open the READMEs in your favourite editor.

3. Interested in using this setup for your own system? This is certainly possible! Our [MPC](./catkin_ws/src/mpc) package can easily be extended to other robotic platforms and tasks by defining different models, objectives, constraints, etc. Furthermore, it supports data logging, visualization, and real-time performance evaluation.



## Overview
The setup consists of several submodules, each with its own purpose.

> :information_source: The submodule links below are relative to this directory and do not work in the browser with the current version of GitHub (see https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/51141). Either manually navigate to the submodule in the browser or clone the repository recursively and click on the links in your IDE.

## Install
### GitHub
We recommend setting up your connection with GitHub using SSH. See [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) for more information.


### Docker
Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) by following the instructions on [this page](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker). Give Docker sudo rights by following the instructions on [this page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).


### Python 3
The solver generation code in the [MPC](./catkin_ws/src/mpc) repository requires Python 3. See the [MPC README](./catkin_ws/src/mpc/README.md) for more information.


### ACADOS
See the [mpc_model_id_mismatch README](./catkin_ws/src/mpc_model_id_mismatch/README.md) for the required version of ACADOS and how to install it.


### ForcesPro license
The MPC implementations use a ForcesPro solver. Therefore, first request a ForcesPro license and install the client. To this end, follow the corresponding instructions in the [MPC README](./catkin_ws/src/mpc/README.md).


### MATLAB and packages
Please refer to the [MPC-SDP README](./catkin_ws/src/mpc/mpc_solver/scripts/include/offline_computations/mpc-sdp/README.md) for the MATLAB version and packages that were used to run the offline terminal ingredients design.


### Access to agiclean
The [agiclean](./catkin_ws/src/agiclean) package provides a custom version of the [Agilicious](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/agilicious) stack. For using the Agilicious stack a license is required, see [this page](https://agilicious.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for more information. After obtaining the license, you can request access to [agiclean](./catkin_ws/src/agiclean) by contacting [Sihao Sun](https://sihaosun.github.io/).



## Set up Docker
To set up the Docker container, following the instructions below:
1. Go to the `src` directory of this repo:
    ```bash
    cd src
    ```

2. Build the Docker image by filling in the required arguments:
    ```bash
    sudo ./docker_build.sh
    ```
    Give the Docker image a descriptive name, such as *agi*.

3. Create and run container from the built image by filling in the required arguments:
    ```bash
    ./docker_run.sh
    ```
    Give the Docker container a descriptive name, such as *johndoe-paper-rohmpc* and provide an arbitrary number for the Falcon ID, for example 7. From now on, we refer to the container with this name.

4. Start the [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) project [rohmpc.yml](./config_files/.tmuxinator/rohmpc.yml):
    ```bash
    tmuxinator start rohmpc
    ```
    This will start a pre-defined [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) session with the name *rohmpc* providing several useful terminal windows. Attach to the running tmux session using `arohmpc` and kill it using `krohmpc`.

    > :information_source: Compared to the default tmux settings, we have changed the prefix key to `Ctrl-a` for convenience of usage, see the [tmux.conf](./config_files/dotfiles/.tmux.conf) file for more information.

5. Leave the container and source the following aliases in the *~/.bashrc* file on your host machine:
    ```bash
    alias cdrohmpcsolver='cd <path_to_repo>/src/catkin_ws/src/mpc/mpc_solver'
    alias agi_gen_rohmpc_solver_x86='cdrohmpcsolver; ./setup_script.sh -c tmpc_settings.py -c pmpc_settings.py -s falcon -f X86'
    ```
    where `<path_to_repo>` is the path to this repository on your host machine.

6. After sourcing the aliases, generate the ROHMPC solver:
    ```bash
    agi_gen_rohmpc_solver_x86
    ```
    In the [mpc_solver](./catkin_ws/src/mpc/mpc_solver) package, this will generate a directory *falcon* in the [include](./catkin_ws/src/mpc/mpc_solver/include/mpc_solver/) and [src](./catkin_ws/src/mpc/mpc_solver/src) directories and a file *cmake_globalvars.cmake* in the [src](./catkin_ws/src/mpc/mpc_solver/src) directory.

7. After generating the solver, you can build the catkin workspace inside the Docker container. To do this, run the following command in the *build* window of the tmux session (by pressing `arrow-up`):
    ```bash
    catkin build agiros
    ```

8. After a successful build of the workspace you have to source the setup file of the workspace in every terminal you are going to use. The easiest way to do this is to restart the tmux session by pressing `Ctrl-a` and then `d` to detach from the session, run `krohmpc` to kill the session, and then start it again with `srohmpc`. This will automatically source the setup file in every terminal of the tmux session.

9. You are ready to reproduce! Checkout the following section for the next steps.



## Reproduce
If everything above is set up correctly, all steps in the pipeline should run out of the box. These steps include:
1. [Uncertainty quantification](./uq.md)
2. [Robust and terminal ingredients design](./robust_term_design.md)
3. [Tightening calibration](./tightening_calib.md)
4. [ROHMPC deployment and analysis](./rohmpc.md)
